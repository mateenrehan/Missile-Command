A very Simple and intuttive gameplay:
1) The launcher located at the center generates the anti-missiles and you should try and protect that the most. If the launcher is destroyed you will lose the game as there is no way without the launcher you will be able to save the buildings/city.
2) The next important thing that you need to save is the buildings. If all the six buildings are destroyed you will lose the game.
3) Right now we have set up 40 missiles each changing levels at 10 missiles and with the level change the speed of missile generation will increase so you will have less time to shoot the missiles. You can expand the game by adding as many levels as you want and increase the speed.
4) Once you successfully defend 40 missiles you will be declared winner.
